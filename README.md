# camera
This program imitates a photo camera software - it calculates exposure (aperture and shutter speed) based on standard input data. <br>
<br>
The program gets the following data as input:
- the most important one is light intensity. In real life camera gets it from it's lightmeter. Lightmeter's output is an electric current, which is presented here as a number. This number should be a whole number from 1 to approx. 1 bln, with standard daylight being in the area of 1 mln - 5 mln.
- info about max and min apertures of the lens that is connected to the camera body. Simply speaking, aperture is a hole in a lens through which light enters the camera, and this hole can change in size. Of course, the bigger the hole, the more light can enter the camera within given time. Number-wise, the smaller the aperture's number, the bigger the hole, so the max possible aperture is 2.8, and the min possible aperture is 32. Another thing to know about aperture is that the smaler the hole (and higher the number), the bigger depth-of-field is (depth-of-field describes distance behind and in front of the point, on which the lens is carrently focussed, where objects are still acceptably sharp).
- focal length of the lens in mm. It is used to calculate longest feasable shutter speed (a time, for which the shutter is open and light reaches the film or CCD). There is a rule of thumb that ( if a camera is handheld ) for a 50 mm lens longest time should be 1/50 of a second, for a 100 mm lens longest time should be 1/100 of a second, and so on. If shutter speed used is longer than this rule says, usually picture will be ruined because of camera shake. 
- film speed, that is, a sensitivity of film or CCD to light. The higher film speed's number, the more sensitive film or CCD is, and the less light is needed to produce a correctly exposed picture. <br><br>

In addition, there are 3 options for camera usage - handheld, on a monopod and on a tripod. <br>For handheld, longest shutter speed is calculated according to the mentioned rule of thumb, and rounded towards shorter existing setting, so it the rule says 1/50 of a second, 1/60 of a second is selected as 1/50 setting does not exist (shutter speeds cannot be adjusted smoothly). <br>For a monopod, longest shutter speed is calculated as 4 times longer than this rule says, for example:  100 mm lens -> the handheld rule says 1/100 of a second -> on a monopod it will be 4 times longer, ie 1/25 of a second. In reality it is rounded to 1/30 of a second as 1/25 setting doesn't exist.<br>For a tripod, this rule is ignored as the camera is supposed to be completely stable, so shutter speed may be as long as 30 seconds (the longest that this camera can provide). <br><br>
Before we continue to other program's features, some extra explanation is required.<br><br>
It has already been mentioned that aperture (that hole in the lens) can change, and the smaller the aperture number, the bigger the hole (and vice versa). Usually aperture scale has following settings: 2.8 - 4 - 5.6 - 8 - 11 - 16 - 22 - 32, and jumping from one setting to the next lets in twice as much (or as little) light. There is a special professional word for those settings - f-stops, and it is used like this: Let's say we are at setting 5.6. If we close the lens down two f-stops, we get to setting 11 (5.6 -> 8 -> 11), and if we open the lens up two stops, we get to setting 2.8 (5.6 -> 4 -> 2.8). <br>
When talking about f-stops, there is another rule of thumb in photography: usually the lens is at it's best optical quality when it is closed 2 f-stops down from it's maximum aperture, so it a particular lens's max aperture is 2.8, it's best quality is at 5.6 (2.8 -> 4 -> 5.6); if the max is 4, the best is 8. <br><br>
Getting back to program's other features: you can choose between 4 different subject modes: full program, landscape, action and portrait. <br>
Full program mode: Here the program tries to use that best f-stop that was discussed above. If (considering given light intelsity, film speed and range of feasable shutter speeds) it is possible to achieve proper exposure, then this f-stop is selected. If it is not possible, then the program tries f-stops next to the best one (one below and one above). If proper exposure still cannot be achieved, the program starts checking other f-stops, that are further from the best one. If no combination of available f-stops and feasable shutter speesd can provide proper exposure (ie it is too dark or too bright), the program selects one of the extreme setting (largest aperture + longest shutter speed or smallest aperture + shortest shutter speed) and activates over- or underexposure warning.<br>
Portrait mode works the same as full program one, with one difference: it tries to close the lens down just one f-stop and not two, in order to give a shallower depth-of-field that is preferred for portraits.<br>
Lanscape mode tries to close the lens down, so that when photographing a landscape, depth-of-field is as large as possible so that both background and foreground are kept sharp. The best aperture in this mode is the smollest one minus two f-stops (so if the lens's min aperture is 22, th ebest is 11) as at the smallest one optical quality tends to deteriorate sometimes.
