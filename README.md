# camera
This program imitates a photo camera software - it calculates exposure (aperture and shutter speed) based on standard input data. <br>
<br>
The program gets the following data as input:
- the most important one is light intensity. In real life camera gets it from it's lightmeter. Lightmeter's output is an electric current, which is presented here as a number. This number should be a whole number from 1 to approx. 1 bln, with standard daylight being in the area of 1 mln - 5 mln.
- info about max and min apertures of the lens that is connected to the camera body. Simply speaking, aperture is a hole in a lens through which light enters the camera, and this hole can change in size. Of course, the bigger the hole, the more light can enter the camera within given time. Number-wise, the smaller the aperture's number, the bigger the hole, so the max possible aperture is 2.8, and the min possible aperture is 32. 
- focal length of the lens in mm. It is used to calculate longest feasable shutter speed (a time, for which the shutter is open and light reaches the film or CCD). There is a rule of thumb that ( if a camera is handheld ) for a 50 mm lens longest time should be 1/50 of a second, for a 100 mm lens longest time should be 1/100 of a second, and so on. If shutter speed used is longer than this rule says, usually picture will be ruined because of camera shake. 
- film speed, that is, a sensitivity of film or CCD to light. The higher film speed's number, the more sensitive film or CCD is, and the less light is needed to produce a correctly exposed picture. <br><br>

In addition, there are 3 options for camera usage - handheld, on a monopod and on a tripod. <br>For handheld, longest shutter speed is calculated according to the mentioned rule of thumb, and rounded towards shorter existing setting, so it the rule says 1/50 of a second, 1/60 of a second is selected as 1/50 setting does not exist (shutter speeds cannot be adjusted smoothly). <br>For a monopod, longest shutter speed is calculated as 4 times longer than this rule says, for example:  100 mm lens -> the handheld rule says 1/100 of a second -> on a monopod it will be 4 times longer, ie 1/25 of a second. In reality it is rounded to 1/30 of a second as 1/25 setting doesn't exist.<br>For a tripod, this rule is ignored as the camera is supposed to be completely stable, so shutter speed may be as long as 30 seconds (the longest that this camera can provide). <br><br>
In addition to addition :-), there are 4 possible subject modes: full program, landscape, action and portrait.<br>
